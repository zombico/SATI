# RAG SUMMARY: Procurement Guideline for Publicly Funded Organizations (PFOs) in Ontario

This document is Ontario's Procurement Guideline for Publicly Funded Organizations (PFOs)—a voluntary reference tool 
for non-designated charities and not-for-profit groups receiving government funding.

It establishes five core principles (responsible management, value for money, vendor access, quality service, 
and trade compliance) and outlines a nine-step procurement process including planning, market canvas, competitive bidding, 
contracting, and record-keeping. Organizations should match their procurement method (informal, invitational competitive, or open 
competitive) to the purchase value and risk level.
